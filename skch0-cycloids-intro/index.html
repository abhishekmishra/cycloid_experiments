    <h1>Introduction to Cycloids</h1>
    <p>A Cycloid is a curve produced by a wheel (circle) moving along a path.</p>

    <p>The cycloid wheel has a single radius line segment drawn. This radius also rotates as the wheel rotates.</p>

    <div id="sketch0-cycloid-only"></div>

    <p>The cycloid curve is traced by a point on the rim of the wheel as it moves along a path. This point on the rim is the point at which the radius intersects the wheel.</p>
